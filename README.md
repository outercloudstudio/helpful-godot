# Helpful Godot
A collection of useful scripts and resources for the Godot game engine. Since I like to use C# in my projects, most of these are goign to require the mono version of the Godot engine. Additionally the networking library requires riptide and Steamworks.NET to be set up properly.

A slightly older version of these utilities is currently in use to help develop my current indie game project, [Rogue Squad](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3115900/Rogue_Squad/).
